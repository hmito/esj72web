### When you drop off your child

Upon arrival at the childcare center, the childcare provider will ask about the child's physical condition, take the child's temperature, and if there are no problems with the childcare, the childcare will begin.

### Contingencies
In the event of a sudden change in your child's condition, or in the event of an earthquake, fire, or other emergency that requires emergency evacuation, we will entrust the “NPO Child Rearing Support Workers Petit Tomato” with the responsibility of handling the situation. At the same time, we will contact the emergency contact, so please respond promptly. For further details, please refer to the “Child Care Room Agreement”. The same is available at the nursery and must be signed at the time of drop-off.

### Cancellation
Please contact the Child Care Room staff with the name of the applicant, the name of the child, the date and time you wish to cancel, and the account information for which you wish to receive a refund.
