# Session proposal guidelines
* There are three types of sessions: [Symposia](#call-for-symposia), [Workshops](#call-for-workshops),and [Forums](#application-for-forums). Symposium category includes the general symposium as well as two special types: the [Open Session](https://esj-meeting.net/opensession/), where the theme is introduced as a new presentation field within the Ecological Society, and the [ER Symposium](https://esj-meeting.net/er_symposium/), which provides travel support for invited international researchers with free admission to the meeting.**These symposia are the central sessions of the meeting**. The ESJ has traditionally considered **workshops as important opportunities to discuss unconventional topics and launch new fields in Ecology**. Please understand the concept of these session (described below) and submit your proposal. We look forward to receiving enthusiastic proposals from researchers from various positions, genders, and nationalities.

## CALL FOR SYMPOSIA
* The participants of the meetings usually prefer to join symposia on various subjects. Thus, they expect new topics not yet covered in recent ESJ symposia. To promote interdisciplinary exchange, it is possible to invite non-ESJ members to be symposium speakers (they will not have to pay the registration fee). Kindly be aware that the same non-member cannot be invited to give guest lectures for two consecutive years.  
* Each symposium will be held for three hours. We are planning to hold the symposia in a hybrid style (i.e., onsite & online) but, in principle, speakers will give their presentations on-site. **Please note that the presentations in symposia will be recorded and distributed on-demand during ESJ72 meeting and for about a month afterward.** The recording permissions will be confirmed when the proposal is submitted. 

### Procedures for symposia organizers
* The deadline for the submission of symposia and workshops proposals is **23:59 (JST), Thursday, 31 October 2024.**
* The Annual Meeting Planning Committee will not be involved in the content of the symposia. However, symposium proposals that are judged to contain contents that slander or libel any individual or organization will be declined.
* When submitting the proposal for symposia, organizers are requested to answer whether the entire meeting (including an explanation of the purpose and comments by the commentator) can be distributed on-demand and whether each presentation can be distributed on-demand.
* Organizers will register all the presentations at once. **Before submitting the proposal, organizers should collect information on each presentation (title, names, and affiliations of speakers and co-presenters) in both Japanese and English, as well as the membership numbers of organizers, co-organizers, and speakers (login IDs for invited speakers).**
* Please access the [registration site](https://esj-meeting.net/regist_information/) and enter the symposium title, abstract (maximum 800 characters in Japanese, 200 words in English), and information for each presentation. Please note that the information of co-presenters will also be confirmed by this entry and cannot be changed at the time of the abstract submission.

### Procedures for symposia speakers
* Except for non-ESJ member invited speakers, only members who have applied for membership in ESJ by Thursday, 31 October 2024 and have paid the annual membership fee by 31 January 2025 (regular and honorary members, hereinafter the same) are eligible to speak at the symposium.
* All speakers (except invited speakers) are required to pay the meeting registration fee by the day of the meeting. We recommend that you pay the fee as early as possible to log in to the meeting platform smoothly.
* **Each speaker is requested to provide the following information, in both Japanese and English, to the symposium organizer by the symposium proposal deadline (31 October 2024): title (maximum 40 characters in Japanese and 150 characters in English), name and affiliation of the speaker and co-presenters, and the speaker's membership number (login ID for invited speakers).** Please also let the organizer know whether you would like your presentation to be distributed on-demand.

### [Limitations on submitting proposals](https://esj-meeting.net/regist_information/##eligibility-for-presentations)
* Organizers (including co-organizers, hereinafter the same) must be ESJ members (regular and honorary members, hereafter the same). Non-ESJ members are not eligible to be organizers.

* Explanation of the purpose, comments, and expressions of opinions without abstract registration are not counted as presentations in the symposia. Therefore, these are not subject to the limitation of overlapping presentations mentioned above.
* At least two speakers are required to apply for the organization of a symposium. If you have only one speaker, please apply for the organization of a workshop.

### Use of English is encouraged
* ESJ has seen an increase in the number of international students and participants from overseas attending its meetings. To further promote research exchange among participants, we encourage the use of English (including in combination with Japanese) in symposia.
* For symposia held in Japanese, please try to include English on the slides and prepare a simple English handout, if possible (handouts and bilingual slides are also effective in encouraging non-English speakers to participate in English-language symposia).


## CALL FOR WORKSHOPS
*  ESJ72 is calling for workshops. The ESJ has traditionally regarded workshops as valuable opportunities to explore unconventional topics and initiate new fields in ecology.
* The workshops are planned to be around 90 minutes long. **We will confirm your preference for online or hybrid participation at the time of application.** If the event is held in a hybrid format, speakers will be expected to present on site. Presentations will be recorded and are expected to be available on-demand to conference participants either during the conference or for about a month afterward. We will confirm the recording permissions when the proposal is submitted.

### Procedures for organizers of workshops
* The deadline for applications for workshops is **23:59 (JST), Thursday, 31 October 2024.**
* **In terms of respecting diversity, organizers are requested to consider the speakers' positions, gender, etc. when choosing the speakers that will participate in a workshop.**
* The Annual Meeting Planning Committee will not be involved in the contents of the workshop, but workshops that are judged to include content that defames specific persons or organizations will not be accepted.
* When submitting the proposal, organizers are requested to answer whether the entire workshop (including an explanation of the purpose and comments by the commentator) can be distributed on-demand and whether each presentation can be distributed on-demand.
* Organizers will register all the presentations at once. Before submitting the proposal, organizers should collect information on each presentation (title, names and affiliations of speakers and co-presenters) in both Japanese and English, as well as the membership numbers of organizers, co-organizers, and speakers (no need to enter the membership numbers for those who make comments and/or express opinions without abstract registration). Please access the registration site and enter the workshop title, abstract (maximum 800 characters in Japanese, 200 words in English), and information for each presentation. Please note that the information of co-presenters will also be confirmed by this entry and cannot be changed at the time of abstract submission.

### Acceptance or rejection of a workshop
* We are planning to secure enough Zoom accounts. However, if the number of proposals exceeds that of previous years, we will hold a lottery to decide whether to accept or reject the proposed workshop.
* You will be notified by e-mail about three weeks after the deadline.

### Procedures for workshop speakers
* **Only members who have applied for membership in ESJ by Thursday, 31 October 2024 and have paid the annual membership fee by 31 January 2025 are eligible to speak at the workshop.** However, non-ESJ members can make comments and/or express opinions without registering an abstract.
* All speakers are required to pay the meeting registration fee by the day of the meeting. We recommend that you pay the fee as early as possible to log in to the meeting platform smoothly.
* Each speaker is requested to provide the following information, in both Japanese and English, to the workshop organizer by the workshop proposal deadline (31 October 2024): title (maximum 40 characters in Japanese and 150 characters in English), name and affiliation of the speaker and co-presenters, and the speaker's membership number (login ID for invited speakers).

### Concept and application limits for workshops
* The ESJ has traditionally considered workshops as important opportunities to discuss unconventional topics and launch new fields in Ecology.
* For the workshop, the explanation of the purpose, registered overview, and the abstracts of individual presentations will be posted on the meeting webpage and meeting platform.
* [Organizers](https://esj-meeting.net/regist_information/) (including co-organizers, hereafter the same) need to be ESJ members (regular and honorary members, hereafter the same). Non-ESJ members cannot become organizers.
* [Speakers](https://esj-meeting.net/regist_information/##eligibility-for-presentations) (main explainer of the talk, hereafter the same) need to be ESJ members. Non-ESJ members cannot become invited speakers. However, non-ESJ members can make comments and/or express opinions without registering an abstract.
* Workshop speakers and organizers can be speakers at either oral or poster sessions.
* Workshop speakers and organizers cannot be organizers or speakers of symposia and/or other workshops.

### Notes
* It is also possible to hold a workshop without abstract registration, such as an opinion session or lightning talk. In this case, you do not need to register for your presentation.
* Explanation of the purpose of the workshop, comments, and expressions of opinions without abstract registration are not counted as presentations. Therefore, the information of the person who makes comments and opinions without abstract registration should not be registered as a speaker but should be included in the meeting abstract.
* Those who will make comments and/or express opinions without registering for abstracts must also register for the meeting or purchase a ticket for workshops. Please remind the organizers.

## APPLICATION FOR FORUMS
Forums are organized by the committees of ESJ and are aimed at inviting broad opinions of ESJ members on ecology-related issues in which ESJ is engaged. The ESJ addresses, promotes, and shares information among ESJ members and develops agreement within ESJ via widespread discussion. Ecological Society of Japan members (regular and honorary members, hereafter the same) can attend forums for free regardless of registration for attendance. Organizing and providing topics for forums are exempted from the "one presentation rule." Tentative proposals for forums are due 13 September 2024. The proposals will be considered by the Board of Directors and the final decision will be made for each proposal after an adjustment between the Annual Meeting Planning Committee and the Organizing Committee of ESJ72. Organizers may be asked to revise the proposal or style of the forums. **For forums that have been accepted, organizers will be invited to apply for a full proposal via the online registration system. Each forum will be held for 90 minutes.**

### Notes
* Non-member meeting participants (those who pay the registration fee) can attend the forums.
* Non-members who have workshop tickets cannot attend the forums.
* Non-member speakers invited to the forums can attend forums for free. To attend other sessions (e.g., symposia, oral, and poster sessions), they are required to pay the registration fee.
