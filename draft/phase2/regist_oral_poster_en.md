## English Oral Presentation Award

The English Oral Presentation Award (EPA) is designed to promote research presentations in English at the conference and to create more opportunities for discussion with international students and international participants. At the same time, we hope to increase opportunities to improve communication skills and international information dissemination, especially for early career researchers.

This award is not a competition for fluency in English or other language skills. Applicants are invited to compete on the basis of the academic content of their presentations as well as their presentation skills and attitude, and the prize will be awarded to those whose presentations are judged to be outstanding by a panel of judges.

### Eligibility

- Applicants must be students (undergraduate, master's, doctoral) or members of the Ecological Society of Japan within 5 years of receiving their degree by March 2025 (childcare/nursing care leave is not included in this 5-year period).
- Past winners of the EPA Grand Prize are not eligible to apply, but past winners of the Excellence Award are eligible to apply. Please note that these eligibility requirements may change after the next competition, ESJ72.

### Judging Criteria

- The judging will be conducted by a panel of judges who will evaluate the entries on a point-by-point basis. Applications for presentations and awards must be submitted through the conference application website.

## Poster Presentation Award

In order to encourage research activities of young researchers in the early stages of their careers, poster presentation awards will be given for outstanding poster presentations. From the viewpoint of securing judges, the maximum number of poster award applications will be set at 500 for this conference. For general posters, there is no upper limit on the number of applications.

### Eligibility

- Student members who have not obtained a doctoral degree as of the deadline for general presentations are eligible to apply.
- However, those who have received the “Grand Prize” or “Excellence Award” for the Poster Prize at past Ecological Society of Japan congresses are not eligible to apply even if they meet the above requirements. Past Ecological Society of Japan congresses include those run jointly with EAFES.
- Speakers who requested “TODO: Publicly solicited session theme” as their presentation text or as the theme of the publicly solicited session are also not eligible to apply for the Poster Award.
- In order to ensure efficient judging, all applicants for the Poster Awards are required to submit a graphical abstract and an explanatory video as presentation content in addition to the poster itself. However, the content of the graphical abstract and explanatory video will not affect the judging process.

### Judging Criteria

The following points will be emphasized in the selection process. Poster award applicants are requested to take these points into consideration when preparing their posters.

- Posters will be judged on their ability to convey information, i.e., whether the research content is presented in an easy-to-understand manner.
  For example, (1) a good title, (2) a clear abstract, (3) a device to attract the eye, and (4) a device to convey the general content in a short period of time may be necessary. To this end, it is important that the text and figures are easy to read, that there is not too much information, and that the main points can be understood without explanation. To ensure fairness, please do not change the title of your abstract after it has been registered.
- The quality of the research is also subject to review. In particular, (1) novelty and originality, (2) quality and quantity of data, (3) validity of analysis methods, and (4) validity of arguments and conclusions will be reviewed.

### Precautions

- In order to secure judges, the number of poster award applications will be capped at 500. Applications will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis, and if the limit is reached, the poster will be presented as a general poster or oral presentation.
- For the online poster presentation, you can upload a graphical abstract, poster, supplementary materials (PDF), and supplementary materials (video), but only the main body of the poster will be reviewed (even if it is also displayed on-site, only the (Only the online poster will be reviewed, even if it is also posted onsite). (Even if the poster is also displayed onsite, only the online poster will be subject to judging.) The online poster itself is expected to be in the format of “approximately 4 x A4 landscape pages.
- Presentation techniques” that have been subject to judging in the past will not be included in the judging at this year's competition. However, for items that are difficult to evaluate just by looking at the posters, judges may ask questions to the presenters using text chat or the video conferencing function during the core time, and evaluate them based on their responses.
- Consideration will also be given to researchers who do not understand Japanese. However, if there is a tie, the poster that can be understood in English will be moved up in the ranking. A poster that can be understood in English means, at a minimum, that the title, introduction, and conclusions are written in English so that the researcher can understand the outline of the research just by reading the English, or that there is a poster with the language in the poster changed to English (English version poster) on a separate page.
- If the language used is “English” or “Bilingual,” please include instructions in English in the poster or provide a poster with the language changed to English within the poster (English version poster).

## Awards for Online Poster Presentations

- In addition to the traditional poster awards, there will be a “Like” award and a “Best Discusser” award, which will be selected by all conference participants. Award and Best Discusser Award will be established for the poster presentations at the conference.
- These awards are not official awards of the Ecological Society of Japan, but are given independently by the ESJ72.
- The winners of these awards will be announced at ONLINE CONF and on the conference website as soon as they are determined.

### “Like! Award

- With the intention of stimulating communication among participants through the comment function, an award separate from the regular poster awards will be established for this year's conference. Selection will be based on the number of votes (“Likes!”) The number of valid votes will be counted as valid votes. Only votes cast by those who leave comments on the poster presentation will be counted as valid votes. All conference participants, including high school students, are eligible to vote.
- In the selection process for this award, the poster that receives the most viewers will be favored. Therefore, due to the nature of the viewing system, the younger numbered posters may have an advantage.

### Best Discusser Award

- An award will be presented to an individual conference participant who has contributed to the excitement of poster and high school student poster presentations by posting quality comments.
- The number of “Likes! comments will be tallied for each conference participant and selection will be made. The right to “Like! comments will be tallied for each participant and selected.
- This award was created specifically to encourage communication among participants using the comment function.
